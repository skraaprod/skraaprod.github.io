<h2>Yann Nitzpon</h2>
<body>
<p>After taking the decision to pursue the scientific path of baccalauréat and immediately  chose the "Science of engineering" option for which I had a lot more interest than for the "Biology" option, I had to choose which tasks I wanted to accomplish for the the "TPE project".
This project consisted in a robot equipped with a camera that could transmit a live feed (of the video it took) through an application that I entirely designed and that also could pilot the robot thanks to wi-fi. Being already really interested in programming, I convinced my group to let me make the application, and so I started to learn about some aspect of application creation on the Android platform.
For my senior year project, I also managed the creation of the application, but this time the application enabled the user to control a massaging jacket.
During those two years, I deepened my knowledge in programming, that rapidly became a passion. I'm really interested in the learning of programming languages and other aspects of programming, and I'm convinced that this video-game project will help me in this way.
I will be able to expand my knowledge in C# and I will use the software Unity for the fist time in order to create a video-game.</p>

<h2>Gaétan Diawara</h2>
<body>
<p>I am Gaétan Diawara, I am 18. I am an engineer Wannabe. It is not my first project of programming, I already coded in python, C++, C#, Java et Visual Basics either for my own pleasure or for school. The back stories come for most of them from my head. I’ve always wanted to code something that I will be judged for (I was for the BAC but It was pretty easy, so I don’t consider it).</p>

<h2>Maxime Lizandier</h2>
<body>
<p> Last year I was in a S-SVT class, where I followed the specialty ISN. During this class I learned the Java language, and I also had to realize a group project. 
It was the first time I ever coded, and I instantly knew I would love this class. And I did. The problems faced when programing always makes me want to know more and more. 
I believe that the team work is essential and I will never let my group down, I know that I can trust them and I hope it is reciprocal. This game project will bring me plenty of experience for the future and I'm looking forward to work with these people. 
I consider myself as curious and kind of artistic, I am sure that it can bring a lot to this group.</p>
