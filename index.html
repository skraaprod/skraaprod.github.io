<p>We are Skraa Production, and we are working on our game named Skraa Party, which is coming out in 2018 ! It has been 9 years since Left 4 Dead 2 came out, and this game is the inspiration and the base of our project, mixing cooperation and first person shooter, two features loved by our group.<p>


<p>Skraa Party will take place in "Skraa Land", an abandoned and cursed park. Our protagonists will be a group of young people, doing urbex, and trying to find a nice place to drink booze and listen to loud music. What they ignore is that they are going to fight to death against a huge number of zombies. This is where the first person shooter dimension takes place in the game, in order to survive these young persons have to kill the evil monsters with fire weapons, with the players controlling one of the heros.<p>

<p>The cooperative dimension of this game is that players will have to work together in order to escape. Zombies will never stop coming, their number will become bigger over time. The goal of this game is to escape from this hell, in order to do so, players will have to find hidden objects all over the map. These objects will either help them fight the enemy, or help them repairing a car which is their only way out.<p>


<p>Every character will have a specific advantage over the other characters, for example one will have more health than the other, a second one will be faster, one will jump higher... But they will also have some disadvantage, if the character has more health he will be heavier and slower, if he is faster he will carry less weapons and objects, if he can jump higher he will have less health and so forth.

Zombies characters will be taken from the Unity Asset Store, guns models, and the players characters will certainly be taken from there too. The map will be a park, as stated above, and created by our group, with several points where players can take cover. Various buildings will be on the map too, for example a house, a fountain, and a lake with a fisher house. The map and the building design will be with Unity3D (2017.3 version) and Blender.<p>
